# Grid View Setup

## This document describes the procedure of installing the Grid View userscript.

---

## Setup

### 1. TamperMonkey

Tampermonkey is a donationware userscript manager that is available as a browser extension.

This software enables the user to add and use so-called userscripts, which are JavaScript programs that can be used to modify web pages.

We'll be installing this extension to give the Grid View userscript the ability to be installed in the first place, and let it modify Google Meet in such a way that it displays everyone. (Hence it's name "Grid View". You know, I *really* don't need to explain this. You're smart enough to understand that on your own.)

Install TamperMonkey as a browser extension for Chrome [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en).

### 2. Grid View UserScript

Now that we've installed TamperMonkey, it's time for the *real deal*.

Head over to the [GreasyFork page for Grid View](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/397862-google-meet-grid-view).

After doing so, you'll be met with the lovely front page of the Grid View UserScript.

![Grid View homepage](/gridview/install.png "The GridView homepage.")

Here, just click on "Install this script".

A new tab will open, this new tab being the install page from TamperMoney. (There's a certain URL scheme that TamperMonkey picks up on.)

![TamperMonkey UserScript install page](/gridview/tampinstall.png "The TamperMonkey UserScript install page")

On this page, click on the "install" button.

The tab will then close, and you *should* be good to go.

### 3. Using

Over at Google Meet, a new button will now pop up:

![Grid View button](/gridview/gridbutton.png "The Grid View button")

Hovering over this button, you'll be able to configure the functionality of the script to your liking.

There we go. You should now be good to go.

I wrote this in English because that's basically the only language I'm comfortable writing in.

Dutch is just so... I can't put my finger on it. It has just become an annoying language to write in.

I will, on the other hand, do my best to translate this entire document as soon as I can so other teachers will be able to use this.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you've learnt something.
